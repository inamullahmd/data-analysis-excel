# Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel

We have a Financial Sales dataset with 700 records, spanning over 16 months.

I have performed the following things using Microsoft Excel:

- **Quick Statistics:** Calculated Mean, Median, Max, Min, Range, First Quartile, and Third Quartile for all the available numerical columns. Also found out the unique values of categorical columns.
- **Pivot Tables and EDA Analysis:** Constructed 7 pivot tables that can be used to construct plots in Excel, through which one can gain insights.
